      FPhrase: "I'm really honored to write the first words of this book, the very
        first one about SFML. /END/ When I started to write this library, in 2006,
        I couldn't imagine that it would become so much popular. Around 100,000 visitors
        per month, 100 new forum posts everyday... this is huge! And this is just
        the beginning; with the release of SFML 2.0, the library makes an important
        step forward. While SFML 1 is a constantly evolving (understand \"unstable\")
        API, SFML 2.0 is meant to be a robust, stable, and mature foundation for
        the future. And hopefully a solid base for more and more great games. Increasing
        popularity also means more effort from the authors to provide complete and
        quality documentation. Sadly, this is often overlooked by developers. Although
        I do my best to provide detailed tutorials for SFML, they are nothing more
        than an improved API documentation. Users often ask me where they can find
        a more complete guide to start programming games with SFML. And until today,
        I had nowhere to direct them to. But Artur, Henrik, and Jan did a great job
        to fill this hole. They have gathered their wisdom and experience into a
        unique book that covers the basics of game programming, as well as everything
        that SFML has to offer\u2014from audio to network, through advanced graphics.
        What I really appreciate about this book is that it is written with the same
        philosophy that is behind SFML: good design, simplicity, and modern code. "
